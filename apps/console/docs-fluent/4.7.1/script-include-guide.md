Script Includes

Guide for creating ServiceNow Script Includes using the Fluent API. Script includes bundle reusable server-side logic into classes or utilities that can be called from business rules, scheduled scripts, other script includes, and client-side code via GlideAjax.


When to Use

• Creating reusable server-side logic (utility classes, helper functions)
• Building server-side APIs callable from client code via GlideAjax
• Sharing business logic across multiple business rules, scheduled scripts, or other server scripts
• Creating AJAX processors for UI Pages or client scripts


Instructions

1. Use Now.include for scripts: The ScriptInclude API only accepts strings, so keep JavaScript in a standalone file and reference it with Now.include('../../server/script-includes/file.js'). This enables syntax highlighting and two-way sync. Note: Script Include class files (Class.create()) should NOT import Glide APIs — they are auto-available in the Script Include execution context.
2. Use ES5 syntax: Use the classic Class.create() pattern or plain functions. ES6 class syntax is not supported on the ServiceNow platform for script includes.
3. Match type to class name: In the Class.create() prototype, the type property must exactly match the class name and the name property in the Fluent definition. Mismatches cause runtime failures.
4. Set clientCallable for GlideAjax: If client-side code needs to call the script include, set clientCallable: true. Without this, GlideAjax calls will be rejected.
5. Set sandboxCallable only when needed: Set sandboxCallable: true only when the script include will be called from sandbox-evaluated expressions such as javascript: query conditions, filter expressions, or column default values. Do not set it by default — it widens the security surface.
6. Extend AbstractAjaxProcessor for AJAX: When the script include is called via GlideAjax, extend global.AbstractAjaxProcessor and use this.getParameter() to read client parameters.
7. Scope accessibility: Set accessibleFrom: 'public' only when other scoped apps need access. Default to 'package_private' for internal use.


Key Concepts

Class-Based vs Classless

• Class-based (most common): Use Class.create() with a prototype. Best for grouping related methods. The type property in the prototype must match the class name.
• Classless (on-demand): A single function that runs when called by name. Best for one-off utility functions. The function name must match the name property.

GlideAjax Pattern

To make a script include callable from client-side code:

1. Set clientCallable: true in the Fluent definition
2. Extend global.AbstractAjaxProcessor in the JavaScript
3. Use this.getParameter('sysparm_name') to read parameters passed from the client
4. Return data as JSON strings for structured responses

Sandbox Callable Pattern

When a sandbox-evaluated expression (e.g., a scheduled script condition, javascript: filter, or column default value) needs complex logic that can't be written as a single expression, create a sandboxCallable script include to hold that logic. The sandbox expression then calls it as a single expression:

• Condition field: new global.MyConditionChecker().shouldRun()
• Filter query: javascript:new global.MyFilterHelper().getFilterValue()

The script include body runs in the normal server-side context where var, if, loops, and GlideRecord are fully supported. Only the calling expression is restricted to a single expression.

Fluent definition (src/fluent/script-includes/sync-condition-checker.now.ts):

```typescript fluent
import '@servicenow/sdk/global'
import { ScriptInclude } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'
import { ScriptInclude } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

ScriptInclude({
    $id: Now.ID['SyncConditionChecker'],
    name: 'SyncConditionChecker',
    script: Now.include('../../server/script-includes/sync-condition-checker.js'),
    description: 'Checks whether daily sync should run',
    sandboxCallable: true,
})
```

JavaScript logic (src/server/script-includes/sync-condition-checker.js):

```javascript
var SyncConditionChecker = Class.create()
SyncConditionChecker.prototype = {
    initialize: function () {},
    shouldRun: function () {
        if (gs.getProperty('x_myapp.sync.enabled', 'false') !== 'true') {
            return false
        }
        var dayOfWeek = new GlideDateTime().getDayOfWeekLocalTime()
        if (dayOfWeek < 2 || dayOfWeek > 6) {
            return false
        }
        var gr = new GlideRecord('x_myapp_queue')
        gr.addQuery('processed', false)
        gr.setLimit(1)
        gr.query()
        return gr.hasNext()
    },
    type: 'SyncConditionChecker',
}
```

Bridging Modules Through Script Includes

Script includes have been the standard way to write reusable server-side code in ServiceNow for years. JavaScript modules are the modern replacement, but many platform features still rely on script includes — GlideAjax, cross-scope APIs, script include-based extension points, and integrations that call script includes by name. When your logic lives in a module but needs to be accessible through one of these legacy mechanisms, create a script include that acts as a thin bridge.

When to use this pattern:

• You have module code that needs to be callable via GlideAjax from client scripts
• Another scoped app needs to call your logic by script include name
• A platform feature (e.g., dynamic reference qualifier, condition script) expects a script include
• You want to keep your business logic in a module (with typed imports, testability, and code reuse) while still being accessible to legacy callers

How it works:

1. Write your business logic in a module file with ES module syntax (import/export)
2. Create a thin Script Include wrapper that uses require() to load the module and delegates to it
3. Define the Fluent record pointing at the wrapper via Now.include()

The wrapper .js file uses Class.create and calls require() to pull in the bundled module from ./dist/modules/. At build time, the SDK bundles your module into the dist/modules/ directory using repack. At runtime on the platform, require() resolves to that bundled output.

Example — exposing a module through a script include:

Module file (src/modules/server/string-utils.js):

```javascript
export function capitalize(text) {
    if (!text) return ''
    return text.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + text.substring(1)
}

export function truncate(text, maxLength) {
    if (!text || text.length <= maxLength) return text
    return text.substring(0, maxLength) + '...'
}
```

Wrapper script (src/server/script-includes/string-utils.js):

```javascript
var StringUtils = Class.create()

StringUtils.prototype = {
    initialize: function () {
        this._mod = require('./dist/modules/server/string-utils.js')
    },

    capitalize: function (text) {
        return this._mod.capitalize(text)
    },

    truncate: function (text, maxLength) {
        return this._mod.truncate(text, maxLength)
    },

    type: 'StringUtils',
}
```

Fluent definition (src/fluent/script-includes/string-utils.now.ts):

```typescript fluent
import '@servicenow/sdk/global'
import { ScriptInclude } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

ScriptInclude({
    $id: Now.ID['StringUtils'],
    name: 'StringUtils',
    script: Now.include('../../server/script-includes/string-utils.js'),
    description: 'Bridge to string utility module',
})
```

Key rules for the wrapper:

• Keep the wrapper as thin as possible — it should only require() the module and delegate. All business logic belongs in the module.
• The wrapper uses Class.create and must NOT import Glide APIs (they are auto-available in Script Include context).
• The module file MUST import Glide APIs from @servicenow/glide (they are NOT auto-available in module context).
• The require() path points to ./dist/modules/... — this is the bundled output location. Match the path structure of your module source file under src/modules/.
• The type property, class name, and Fluent name must all match exactly.


Avoidance

• Never use ES6 class syntax -- the ServiceNow server runtime does not support it for script includes
• Never mismatch type and class name -- the type property in the prototype, the Class.create() variable name, and the name in the Fluent definition must all match exactly
• Never forget clientCallable: true for GlideAjax -- client calls will silently fail without it
• Avoid inline scripts for anything beyond a one-liner -- use Now.include() for maintainability and syntax highlighting

Examples

Basic Script Include

Fluent definition (src/fluent/script-includes/math-utils.now.ts):

```typescript fluent
import '@servicenow/sdk/global'
import { ScriptInclude } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

export const MathUtils = ScriptInclude({
    $id: Now.ID['MathUtils'],
    name: 'MathUtils',
    script: Now.include('../../server/script-includes/math-utils.js'),
    description: 'Basic math utility functions',
    accessibleFrom: 'package_private',
})
```

JavaScript logic (src/server/script-includes/math-utils.js):

> Important: Script Include class files (Class.create pattern) must NOT import Glide APIs — they are auto-available in the Script Include execution context. See the module-guide topic.

```javascript
var MathUtils = Class.create()
MathUtils.prototype = {
    initialize: function () {},

    multiply: function (a, b) {
        return a * b
    },

    type: 'MathUtils', // IMPORTANT: must match the class name
}
```

GlideAjax Script Include (Client-Callable)

Fluent definition (src/fluent/script-includes/todo-ajax.now.ts):

```typescript fluent
import '@servicenow/sdk/global'
import { ScriptInclude } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

export const TodoAjax = ScriptInclude({
    $id: Now.ID['TodoAjax'],
    name: 'TodoAjax',
    script: Now.include('../../server/script-includes/todo-ajax.js'),
    description: 'AJAX processor for to-do operations',
    clientCallable: true,
    accessibleFrom: 'public',
})
```

JavaScript logic (src/server/script-includes/todo-ajax.js):

```javascript
var TodoAjax = Class.create()

TodoAjax.prototype = Object.extendsObject(global.AbstractAjaxProcessor, {
    getTasks: function () {
        var tasks = []
        var gr = new GlideRecord('x_snc_todo_item')
        gr.query()

        while (gr.next()) {
            tasks.push({
                sys_id: gr.getUniqueValue(),
                task: gr.getValue('task'),
                state: gr.getValue('state'),
            })
        }

        return JSON.stringify(tasks)
    },

    addTask: function () {
        var task = this.getParameter('sysparm_task')
        var state = this.getParameter('sysparm_state') || 'ready'

        var gr = new GlideRecord('x_snc_todo_item')
        gr.initialize()
        gr.setValue('task', task)
        gr.setValue('state', state)
        var sysId = gr.insert()

        return JSON.stringify({
            success: true,
            task: { sys_id: sysId, task: task, state: state },
        })
    },

    type: 'TodoAjax',
})
```
