ServiceNow Fluent Overview

ServiceNow Fluent is a domain-specific language (DSL) based on TypeScript for defining the metadata files [sys_metadata] that make up applications. It includes APIs for tables, roles, ACLs, business rules, Automated Test Framework tests, and more.


Cross-Cutting Language Constructs

Some Fluent features apply across every API rather than belonging to a specific record type — Now.include, Now.attach, Now.ref, the data helpers (Duration, TemplateValue, etc.), and the $override escape hatch. These live in the fluent/ folder of the SDK docs and all share the fluent-language tag. Use that tag to discover them as a group: now-sdk explain fluent-language returns every cross-cutting topic. Read these first when working in any .now.ts file — they apply regardless of which API you're calling.

Developers define metadata in a few lines of code instead of through a form or builder tool user interface. Applications created or converted with ServiceNow platform tools or the ServiceNow SDK support developing in ServiceNow Fluent.

ServiceNow Fluent supports two-way synchronization, which allows changes to metadata to be synced from other Now Platform user interfaces into source code and changes to source code to be synced back to metadata across the instance.


File Structure

Fluent metadata is defined in .now.ts files. A typical project structure:

```
src/
    fluent/
        business-rules/
            log-state-change.now.ts
        tables/
            to-do.now.ts
    server/
        show-state-update.js
now.config.json
package.json
```


Usage

In .now.ts files, import APIs from @servicenow/sdk/core and define metadata:

```typescript fluent
import { Table, StringColumn, DateColumn, BooleanColumn } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

export const x_snc_example_to_do = Table({
    name: 'x_snc_example_to_do',
    schema: {
        deadline: DateColumn({ label: 'deadline' }),
        task: StringColumn({ label: 'Task', maxLength: 120, mandatory: true }),
        active: BooleanColumn({ label: 'Active' }),
        state: StringColumn({
            label: 'State',
            choices: {
                ready: 'Ready',
                in_progress: 'In Progress',
                completed: 'Completed',
            },
        }),
    },
})
```

For sample/demo data, use the Record API, and be sure to set installMethod: 'demo' via the $meta property:

```typescript fluent
import { Record } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

Record({
    $id: Now.ID['example_id0'],
    $meta: { installMethod: 'demo' },
    table: 'x_snc_example_to_do',
    data: {
        state: 'ready',
        task: 'Create a ServiceNow Fluent application',
        active: true,
        priority: 1,
    },
})
```


Server-Side Scripts and Modules

For server-side scripts, use JavaScript modules with import/export. This is the preferred approach — modules provide typed Glide API access, code reuse, and full IDE support. Place module files under src/server/ and import them from .now.ts files:

```typescript fluent
import { BusinessRule } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'
import { showStateUpdate } from '../server/show-state-update'

BusinessRule({
    $id: Now.ID['br0'],
    table: 'x_snc_example_to_do',
    script: showStateUpdate,
    name: 'LogStateChange',
    when: 'after',
    action: ['update'],
})
```

For detailed guidance on module imports, exports, Glide APIs, and Script Include patterns, see the module-guide topic.


Core Difference between UI Pages and UI Formatters

• UI Formatter -- Used inside forms to add non-field content
• UI Page -- Used outside forms as standalone pages

If the request mentions "on the form" or similar keywords (activities, process flow, stages, timeline, attached knowledge, checklist, breadcrumb, CI relationships, contextual search, variable editor, formatters), use UI Formatters. If it's a standalone page/application, use UI Pages.


AI Integration with LLM

For AI-powered capabilities (sentiment analysis, text generation, summarization), use ServiceNow's sn_generative_ai.LLMClient API in server-side scripts:

```javascript
var llmClient = new sn_generative_ai.LLMClient()
var prompt = 'Your specific AI task prompt here'

try {
    var result = llmClient.call({ prompt: prompt })
    if (result.status === 'Success') {
        var response = result.response.trim()
    } else {
        gs.error(result.response)
    }
} catch (e) {
    gs.error(e.message)
}
```

The recommended pattern is to create a Script Include for LLM operations, then call it from Business Rules, Scripted REST APIs, or via GlideAjax from client scripts.
