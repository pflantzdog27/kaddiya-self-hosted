Registering Events Guide

Guide for registering custom ServiceNow events in the Event Registry (sysevent_register) using the Record API, including custom queue configuration for high-volume event processing. Use when a custom event name is referenced, when building event-driven applications, or when the user mentions event registry, custom events, gs.eventQueue(), or custom queues.


When to Use

• Use proactively as a prerequisite step whenever a custom event name is referenced. The event must be registered before it can be fired or consumed.
• When building event-driven applications that need to fire or consume custom events.
• When the user mentions "event registry", "register event", "custom event", gs.eventQueue(), or sysevent_register.
• When the user mentions "custom queue", "event queue", or high-volume event processing.

When to Use Event-Based Approach

| Scenario | Use Event-Based? |
|----------|-----------------|
| Single reaction to a record change | No -- direct action is simpler |
| One trigger, multiple independent reactions | Yes |
| Passing contextual data to downstream consumers | Yes |
| Asynchronous processing that shouldn't block the user | Yes |


Instructions

1. Use the Record API: There is no dedicated Fluent plugin for sysevent_register. Always use Record() with table: 'sysevent_register'.
2. Scope-aware field usage:
   • Global apps: Set event_name directly. Leave suffix blank.
   • Scoped apps: Set both suffix AND event_name: '<scope>.<suffix>' explicitly. The platform does not auto-generate event_name on initial Record API creation.
3. CRITICAL -- 40-character limit on event_name: Values longer than 40 characters are silently truncated. Always verify <scope>.<suffix> fits within 40 characters.
4. Derive $id from the event name: Use a stable $id that maps 1-to-1 with the event name to prevent duplicate records on rebuild.
5. Never set derived_priority: It is read-only and auto-computed.
6. Register before firing: The event must exist before any code calls gs.eventQueue() or fires from Flow Designer.
7. Always populate fired_by: Document what fires the event for maintainability.
8. Always export the Record when used with flows: So flows can import and reference myEvent.$id.
9. Use custom queues for high-volume events: Prevents flooding the default processor and allows serial processing to avoid race conditions.


Avoidance

• Never omit event_name in scoped apps -- always set it explicitly as <scope>.<suffix> alongside suffix.
• Never omit suffix in scoped apps -- it is mandatory alongside event_name.
• Never modify suffix on existing scoped events -- changing it regenerates event_name and breaks all listeners.
• Never exceed 40 characters for event_name -- silently truncated with no warning.
• Never use two different $id values for the same event_name -- creates duplicate registrations causing listeners to fire twice.
• Never fire an event before registering it -- fails silently in scoped apps.
• Never leave fired_by blank.
• Never pass priority as a String -- the field expects an integer.
• Never forget to export the event Record when referenced by a flow.

Event Registry API Reference

Register events using Record() with table: 'sysevent_register'.

Data Fields

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| event_name | String (max 40) | -- | Primary identifier. Scoped: set as <scope>.<suffix>. Global: set directly. |
| suffix | String (max 40) | Yes (scoped) | Mandatory in scoped apps alongside event_name. Not used in global apps. |
| description | String (max 100) | -- | When and why the event fires. |
| table | String (max 80) | -- | Associated ServiceNow table. |
| fired_by | String (max 100) | -- | What code fires the event (required for traceability). |
| priority | integer | -- | Processing order (lower = higher priority). Default: 100. |
| queue | String | -- | Custom queue name. Must match an existing sysevent_queue record. |
| caller_access | String (choice) | -- | Cross-scope access: '' (none), '1' (tracking), '2' (restriction). |
| derived_priority | Float | -- | READ-ONLY. Never set this field. |

Caller Access Values

| Value | UI Label | Behavior |
|-------|----------|----------|
| '' (default) | None | No restriction. Any caller can fire the event. |
| '1' | Caller Tracking | Cross-scope allowed but logged. |
| '2' | Caller Restriction | Cross-scope blocked by default; admin approval required. |

Examples

Scoped App Event Registration

```typescript fluent
import { Record } from '@servicenow/sdk/core';

Record({
  $id: Now.ID['x-myapp-incident-approved-event'],
  table: 'sysevent_register',
  data: {
    suffix: 'incident.approved',
    event_name: 'x_myapp.incident.approved',
    description: 'Fired when an incident is approved in My App',
    table: 'incident',
    fired_by: 'Business Rule: My App Incident Approvals',
    priority: 200,
  },
});
```

Global App Event Registration

```typescript fluent
import { Record } from '@servicenow/sdk/core';

Record({
  $id: Now.ID['incident-approved-event'],
  table: 'sysevent_register',
  data: {
    event_name: 'incident.approved',
    description: 'Fired when an incident is approved',
    table: 'incident',
    fired_by: 'Business Rule: Incident Approvals',
    priority: 100,
  },
});
```

Event with Caller Tracking

```typescript fluent
import { Record } from '@servicenow/sdk/core';

Record({
  $id: Now.ID['x-myapp-contract-expiring-event'],
  table: 'sysevent_register',
  data: {
    suffix: 'contract.expiring',
    event_name: 'x_myapp.contract.expiring',
    description: 'Fired when a contract is within 30 days of expiry',
    table: 'x_myapp_contract',
    fired_by: 'Business Rule: Contract Expiry Check',
    priority: 100,
    caller_access: '1',
  },
});
```

Event-Driven Flow with Email Notification

Three-file pattern: Event Registration, Flow (fireEvent), Email Notification.

File 1: Register and export the event:

```typescript fluent
import { Record } from '@servicenow/sdk/core';

export const employeeTerminatedEvent = Record({
  $id: Now.ID['sn-myapp-employee-terminated-event'],
  table: 'sysevent_register',
  data: {
    suffix: 'employee.terminated',
    event_name: 'sn_myapp.employee.terminated',
    description: 'Fired when employee status changes to Terminated',
    table: 'sn_myapp_employee_record',
    fired_by: 'Flow: Notify manager on termination',
    priority: 100,
  },
});
```

File 2: Flow fires the event using employeeTerminatedEvent.$id (resolves to sys_id).

File 3: Notification references event by name string 'sn_myapp.employee.terminated'.

> Critical difference: The Flow uses .$id (sys_id reference). The Notification uses the event name string. Mixing them up causes errors.

Event-Driven Business Rule with Script Action

Four-file pattern: Event Registration, Business Rule (gs.eventQueue), ScriptAction, Email Notification.

The business rule fires via gs.eventQueue('sn_myapp.new.employee.added', current, parm1, parm2). The ScriptAction and EmailNotification both reference the full event name string in their eventName fields.

Custom Queue Registration

Use a custom queue when your app generates high volumes of events or when events must be processed serially.

When to Use a Custom Queue

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Low/moderate frequency (tens per hour) | Default queue is sufficient |
| High volume (hundreds/thousands per batch) | Custom queue to isolate traffic |
| Events that must not race each other | Custom queue with sequential mode |
| Isolation from other apps' event traffic | Custom queue |

Queue Naming Convention

Scoped apps: <scope_name>.<suffix> (suffix is mandatory).
Global apps: Plain unique name (no suffix field).

CRITICAL: Queue names must be unique. Always query sysevent_queue before creating.

Custom Queue Properties

| Field | Type | Mandatory | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| sys_class_name | string | Yes | Must be "sysevent_queue" for correct installation. |
| queue | string | Yes | Full queue name. |
| suffix | string | Scoped: Yes | Portion after scope prefix. |
| poll_interval | glide_duration | Yes | Format: "1970-01-01 HH:mm:ss". |
| job_config | string | No | "jobs_per_node" or "job_count". |
| job_config_value | integer | Yes | Number of concurrent jobs. |
| provider | reference | Yes | sys_id of sysevent_queue_provider record. |
| processing_order | string | No | "parallel" or "sequential". |

Available Providers

| Provider | sys_id | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Event Provider | 44af4464431212108da9a574a9b8f2f5 | Default; uses Processing Framework |
| NowMQ Provider | 3ccf4464431212108da9a574a9b8f2fb | In-memory queue for high throughput |

Custom Queue Example

```typescript fluent
import { Record } from '@servicenow/sdk/core';

// Step 1: Create the queue
Record({
  $id: Now.ID['my_app_custom_queue'],
  table: 'sysevent_queue',
  data: {
    sys_class_name: 'sysevent_queue',
    queue: 'sn_my_app.custom_queue',
    suffix: 'custom_queue',
    description: 'General-purpose event queue for my application.',
    poll_interval: '1970-01-01 00:00:30',
    job_config: 'jobs_per_node',
    job_config_value: 1,
    provider: '44af4464431212108da9a574a9b8f2f5',
    automatic_processing: true,
    processing_order: 'parallel',
  },
});

// Step 2: Register the event with the queue name
Record({
  $id: Now.ID['sn_my_app-contract-expiring-event'],
  table: 'sysevent_register',
  data: {
    suffix: 'contract.expiring',
    event_name: 'sn_my_app.contract.expiring',
    description: 'Fired when a contract is within 30 days of expiry',
    table: 'sn_my_app_contract',
    fired_by: 'Business Rule: Contract Expiry Check',
    priority: 100,
    queue: 'sn_my_app.custom_queue',
  },
});
```

Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Install succeeds but queue record missing | Missing sys_class_name | Add sys_class_name: 'sysevent_queue' |
| Events not routing to custom queue | Queue name mismatch | Verify exact name matches |
| Duplicate queue name conflict | Name already exists | Change suffix (scoped) or queue name (global) |
| "Event is not defined" errors | event_name exceeded 40 chars | Shorten <scope>.<suffix> to fit within 40 |
