Scheduled Script Guide

Create ServiceNow Scheduled Script Executions (sysauto_script) to run server-side logic on a time-based schedule. This guide covers all 11 frequency types, script file patterns, timezone handling, conditional execution, business calendar integration, and best practices.


When to Use

• Running server-side logic at a fixed time every day, week, month, or year
• Recurring background maintenance tasks (data cleanup, archiving, cache refresh)
• Periodic data synchronization with external systems
• Generating scheduled reports or summary notifications
• Executing a script exactly once at a future date/time
• Running a script manually on-demand (no automated trigger)
• Scheduling jobs that align with business calendar entries
• Repeating at a custom interval (e.g., every 4 hours, every 30 minutes)


Do NOT Use For

• Structured bulk data imports (CSV, LDAP, REST sources with transform maps)
• Multi-step orchestrations with branching conditions and discrete actions on a timer


Core Principles

1. Choose frequency first: This determines which companion fields are required and which are ignored.
2. Use Now.include for scripts: The ScheduledScript API only accepts strings, so reference an external .js file with Now.include('./path-to-file.js'). The script must use an IIFE: (function() { ... })();.
3. timeZone: All times in executionStart, executionEnd, and executionTime are interpreted in the timeZone you set. Use 'floating' to always match the platform's current system timezone. Avoid setting unless explicitly specified by the user.
4. executionInterval is exclusive to periodically: Setting it on any other frequency is a build error.
5. daysOfWeek is required for weekly: Omitting it is a build error.
6. businessCalendar is required for calendar types: Both business_calendar_start and business_calendar_end require it.
7. executionEnd must allow at least one execution: For recurring jobs, must be at least one full interval after executionStart.


Quick Decision Guide

| User says | Use frequency | Required extra fields |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| "every day at X", "nightly", "daily" | daily | executionTime |
| "every Monday", "on Tuesdays and Fridays" | weekly | daysOfWeek (mandatory; array of lowercase names) |
| "first of the month", "every month on day X" | monthly | dayOfMonth (1-31; 31 = month-end) |
| "every N hours/minutes", "periodically" | periodically | executionInterval (mandatory), executionStart recommended |
| "once", "one-time", "migration" | once | executionStart |
| "manually", "on demand" | on_demand | (none) |
| "every year on [month] [day]" | day_and_month_in_year | month (1-12), dayOfMonth (1-31) |
| "second Monday of every month" | week_in_month | weekInMonth (1-6), dayOfWeek |
| "third Tuesday of March every year" | day_week_month_year | dayOfWeek, weekInMonth, month |
| "when business period starts" | business_calendar_start | businessCalendar |
| "when business period ends" | business_calendar_end | businessCalendar |

Do I need `executionTime`?

• Recommended for: daily, weekly, monthly, day_and_month_in_year, week_in_month, day_week_month_year
• Not applicable: periodically (uses executionInterval), once (uses executionStart), on_demand

Do I need `executionStart`?

• Recommended: periodically, once
• Optional: all other types (use to define when the first execution is eligible)
• If you do not have date/time context from the user, omit it -- Fluent will auto-populate with the current date/time during build.


API Reference

For the full property reference, see the scheduledscript-api topic.

Valid Frequency Values

'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly', 'periodically', 'once', 'on_demand', 'day_and_month_in_year', 'day_week_month_year', 'week_in_month', 'business_calendar_start', 'business_calendar_end'


Run Type Details

• daily -- Runs once per day at executionTime.
• weekly -- Runs on specific weekdays. Requires daysOfWeek (array).
• monthly -- Runs on a fixed day. Requires dayOfMonth. If the day does not exist in a month (e.g., 31 in February), it runs on the last day instead. So dayOfMonth: 31 effectively becomes a month-end job.
• periodically -- Repeats at a fixed interval. Requires executionInterval. Avoid seconds or single-digit minutes for performance. If a run is still executing when the next fires, the platform skips that trigger silently.
• once -- Runs once at executionStart, then stops.
• on_demand -- Never runs automatically; triggered manually.
• day_and_month_in_year -- Runs annually on a fixed date. Requires month + dayOfMonth.
• week_in_month -- Runs on a specific week ordinal. Requires weekInMonth + dayOfWeek.
• day_week_month_year -- Runs on a specific weekday in a specific week in a specific month each year.
• business_calendar_start / business_calendar_end -- Fires when calendar entries begin/end. Requires businessCalendar.


Script File Pattern

The ScheduledScript API only accepts strings for its script property and should use Now.include to import the javascript code, see the now-include topic for more information

The script file must use an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):

```javascript
(function () {
  // your logic here
})();
```

Reference it from the script field:

```typescript fluent
import { ScheduledScript } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

ScheduledScript({
    $id: Now.ID['my-job'],
    name: 'My Job',
    script: Now.include('../../server/scheduled-scripts/my-job.js'),
    frequency: 'daily',
    executionTime: Time({ hours: 2, minutes: 0 }),
})
```

> Note: Unlike BusinessRule and ScriptAction, the ScheduledScript API does not accept function types. Module imports will produce a TypeScript error. Use Now.include() or inline strings.

Script Best Practices

1. Always use an IIFE wrapper
2. Add try-catch blocks for error handling
3. Use gs.info() for success, gs.error() for failures, gs.debug() for tracing
4. Keep scripts focused -- one task per scheduled script
5. Use setLimit() when processing large datasets
6. Return early on failed preconditions
7. Add JSDoc comments explaining the script's purpose


Timezone Handling

• timeZone -- Controls how executionStart, executionEnd, and executionTime are interpreted. Platform stores UTC internally.
• 'floating' -- Always uses the platform's currently configured system timezone.
• userTimeZone -- Controls timezone for GlideDateTime calculations inside the script. Defaults to the runAs user's profile timezone.


Conditional Execution

Set conditional: true and provide a condition expression for dynamic per-cycle skipping.

> Important — Condition field restrictions: The condition field is evaluated in the server-side script sandbox, which only allows single expressions. The following are not allowed in conditions:
>
> - Variable declarations (var, let, const)
> - Control flow (if, for, while, switch, return)
> - Assignment operators (=)
> - Function declarations or IIFEs
> - Multiple statements (semicolons)
> - Object literals
>
> If your condition requires complex logic (multiple checks, GlideRecord queries, aggregates), create a sandboxCallable script include and call it from the condition as a single expression. See the script-include-guide topic for the sandbox callable pattern.

Simple single-expression condition:

```typescript fluent
ScheduledScript({
  $id: Now.ID["conditional-job"],
  name: "Weekday-Only Sync",
  script: Now.include("./conditional-job.server.js"),
  frequency: "daily",
  executionTime: Time({ hours: 6, minutes: 30 }),
  conditional: true,
  condition:
    "gs.getDayOfWeekLocalTime() >= 2 && gs.getDayOfWeekLocalTime() <= 6",
});
```

Complex condition using a sandboxCallable script include:

```typescript fluent
ScheduledScript({
  $id: Now.ID["conditional-sync"],
  name: "Conditional Data Sync",
  script: Now.include("./conditional-sync.server.js"),
  frequency: "daily",
  executionTime: Time({ hours: 9, minutes: 0 }),
  conditional: true,
  condition: "new global.SyncConditionChecker().shouldRun()",
});
```

The companion script include handles the complex logic (property check + weekday check + GlideRecord query) in normal server-side context where var, if, loops, and GlideRecord are fully supported. See the script-include-guide topic for how to create sandboxCallable script includes.

Common use cases: weekend/holiday checks, data-driven execution (system property flags), time-specific logic.


Protection

• protectionPolicy: 'read' -- Others can view but not modify
• protectionPolicy: 'protected' -- Others cannot view or modify
• Omit to allow full customization


Business Calendar Best Practices

• Always reference business calendar entries by sys_id from the business_calendar table
• The platform provides standard entries for weeks, months, quarters, and years
• If the user provides a specific calendar name or sys_id, use that instead
