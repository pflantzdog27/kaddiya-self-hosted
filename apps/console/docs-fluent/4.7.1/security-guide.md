Implementing Security Guide

Implement ServiceNow application security using ACLs (sys_security_acl), Roles (sys_user_role), Security Attributes (sys_security_attribute), and Security Data Filters (sys_security_data_filter). This guide covers the layered security model -- from defining roles, to creating ACL rules, to row-level filtering with data filters and reusable security predicates.


When to Use

• Securing tables, fields, or resources with access control rules
• Creating roles for an application
• Implementing row-level data filtering based on user attributes
• Defining reusable security predicates (Security Attributes)
• Proactively when creating tables with sensitive data or applications needing role-based access control


Overall Security Model

1. Start with Roles: Define roles first -- they are required by ACLs and referenced by Security Attributes.
2. Then ACLs: Create ACL rules to secure tables, fields, and resources. Each ACL secures one operation on one object.
3. Use Security Attributes for reusable predicates: When the same role/condition logic appears in multiple ACLs, extract it into a Security Attribute.
4. Add Data Filters for row-level security: When users should see only certain rows (not the whole table), add Security Data Filters paired with Deny ACLs.


Security Layer Hierarchy

| Layer | API | Purpose |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Roles | Role() | Define personas with permissions |
| ACLs | Acl() | Control access to objects/operations |
| Security Attributes | Record on sys_security_attribute | Reusable security predicates |
| Data Filters | Record on sys_security_data_filter | Row-level filtering |


ACL Evaluation Order

1. Deny-Unless ACLs evaluate first -- if any fail, access is denied
2. Allow-If ACLs evaluate second -- at least one must pass to grant access
3. Within each ACL: roles, condition, and script ALL must pass (the "Trinity")


Roles

Instructions

1. Always prefix role names with the application scope -- e.g., x_my_scope.manager.
2. Use containsRoles for inheritance -- a supervisor role can contain a manager role.
3. For existing platform roles (e.g., itil), look up the sys_id from sys_user_role.
4. You cannot rename roles after they are saved.

Role API Reference

For the full property reference, see the role-api topic.

Role Example

```javascript
import { Role } from "@servicenow/sdk/core";

const managerRole = Role({
  $id: Now.ID["manager_role"],
  name: "x_snc_example.manager"
});

const adminRole = Role({
  $id: Now.ID["admin_role"],
  name: "x_snc_example.admin",
  containsRoles: [managerRole]
});

const supervisorRole = Role({
  $id: Now.ID["supervisor_role"],
  name: "x_snc_example.supervisor",
  containsRoles: [managerRole, "282bf1fac6112285017366cb5f867469"]
  // Fluent object and sys_id of itil role
});
```


ACLs

Instructions

1. ACLs require at least one of: roles, security attribute, condition, or script.
2. The Trinity: All specified conditions (roles AND condition AND script) must evaluate to true to grant access.
3. For table-level access: Use type: 'record' and omit field. For field-level, set field to the column name or "*" for all fields.
4. One ACL per operation: Create separate ACLs for read, write, delete, etc.
5. Use roles for role checks, not scripts -- only use scripts for complex business logic (e.g., ownership checks).

ACL API Reference

For the full property reference, see the acl-api topic.

ACL Examples

Table-level ACL with roles:

```javascript
import { Acl, Role } from "@servicenow/sdk/core";

const travelAgentRole = Role({
  $id: Now.ID["travel_agent_role"],
  name: "sn_travel_app.travel_agent"
});

export default Acl({
  $id: Now.ID["booking_read_acl"],
  type: "record",
  table: "sn_travel_app_booking",
  operation: "read",
  roles: [travelAgentRole],
  adminOverrides: true
});
```

Field-level ACL:

```javascript
export default Acl({
  $id: Now.ID["booking_status_write_acl"],
  type: "record",
  table: "sn_travel_app_booking",
  field: "status",
  operation: "write",
  roles: [travelAgentRole, travelManagerRole],
});
```

Script-based ACL (ownership check):

```javascript
export default Acl({
  $id: Now.ID["booking_delete_owner_acl"],
  type: "record",
  table: "sn_travel_app_booking",
  operation: "delete",
  roles: [travelerRole],
  script: `
    var isOwner = (current.sys_created_by == gs.getUserName());
    var isPending = (current.status == 'pending');
    answer = isOwner && isPending;
  `,
});
```

Deny-Unless ACLs

Deny-Unless ACLs (decisionType: 'deny') evaluate before Allow ACLs and deny access unless conditions are met. They do not grant access on their own -- at least one Allow ACL must also match.

```javascript
// Deny access unless user has itil role
export const incidentDenyUnlessItil = Acl({
  $id: Now.ID["incident_deny_unless_itil"],
  type: "record",
  table: "incident",
  operation: "read",
  decisionType: "deny",
  roles: [itilRole],
});

// Corresponding Allow ACL
export const incidentAllowRead = Acl({
  $id: Now.ID["incident_allow_read"],
  type: "record",
  table: "incident",
  operation: "read",
  decisionType: "allow",
  roles: [itilRole],
});
```

Query ACLs

Query ACLs protect against blind query attacks:
• query_match -- Controls safe operators (EQUALS, IN, NOT_EQUALS, etc.)
• query_range -- Controls dangerous operators (CONTAINS, >=, <=, STARTS_WITH, etc.)

Use when columns contain sensitive values and partial/conditional access exists.

```javascript
export const payrollSalaryQueryRange = Acl({
  $id: Now.ID["payroll_salary_query_range"],
  type: "record",
  table: "payroll",
  field: "salary",
  operation: "query_range",
  decisionType: "deny",
  roles: [hrAdminRole],
});
```


Security Attributes

Use the Record API on sys_security_attribute. Prefer compound type -- it is the only type that can be referenced in ACLs and Data Filters.

Security Attribute Types

| Type | Use for | Can use in ACLs? |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| compound | Role/group conditions via encoded query | Yes |
| true\|false | Complex boolean logic via script | No |
| string / integer / list | Value calculations | No |

Key Rules

• Use condition field for compound types with encoded query syntax (e.g., "Role=manager^ORRole=admin")
• Never use current in security attribute scripts -- no record context available
• Set is_dynamic: false for role/group checks that can be cached per session

Examples

```typescript fluent
import "@servicenow/sdk/global";
import { Record } from "@servicenow/sdk/core";

// Compound type (recommended)
export const hasManagerRole = Record({
  $id: Now.ID["has-manager-role"],
  table: "sys_security_attribute",
  data: {
    name: "HasManagerRole",
    type: "compound",
    label: "Has Manager Role",
    description: "Checks if the current user has the manager role",
    condition: "Role=manager",
    is_dynamic: false
  }
});

// Boolean script type
export const hasFinanceRole = Record({
  $id: Now.ID["has-finance-role"],
  table: "sys_security_attribute",
  data: {
    name: "HasFinanceRole",
    type: "boolean",
    label: "Has Finance Role",
    script: 'answer = gs.hasRole("finance") || gs.getUser().isMemberOf("finance_users");',
    is_dynamic: false
  }
});
```


Security Data Filters

Use the Record API on sys_security_data_filter. Always pair with Deny ACLs -- Data Filters alone do not provide complete security.

Properties

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| description | string | Yes | Descriptive name. |
| table_name | string | Yes | Target table. |
| mode | string | Yes | "if" (filter when condition met) or "unless" (filter unless condition met). |
| security_attribute | reference | Yes | Reference to sys_security_attribute (must be compound type). |
| filter | string | No | Encoded query condition. |
| active | boolean | No | Default: true. |

Key Rules

• security_attribute is required -- always reference a compound Security Attribute
• Use dynamic conditions (e.g., fieldnameDYNAMIC90d1921e5f510100a9ad2572f2b477fe for current user) instead of hardcoded values
• Use indexed columns in filters for performance

Example

```typescript fluent
export const filterFinancialRecords = Record({
  $id: Now.ID["filter-financial-records"],
  table: "sys_security_data_filter",
  data: {
    description: "Restrict high-value transactions to authorized personnel",
    table_name: "finance_transaction",
    mode: "unless",
    security_attribute: hasFinanceRoleAttribute,
    filter: "amount>10000^ORclassification=confidential",
  }
});
```


Avoidance

• Never create roles without scope prefix -- use x_scope.role_name format
• Never use scripts in ACLs for simple role checks -- use the roles property
• Never rely on Data Filters alone -- always pair with Deny ACLs
• Never use current in Security Attribute scripts -- no record context available
• Never hardcode user IDs or names in ACL scripts or Data Filter conditions
• Never use non-compound Security Attributes in ACLs -- only compound type is supported
