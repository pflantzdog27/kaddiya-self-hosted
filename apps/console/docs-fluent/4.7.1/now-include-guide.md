Now.include

Now.include() populates a record field with the contents of a file at build time. It reads the file and inlines its text into the XML output, keeping source files separate for IDE support (syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, linting).

Where an API supports it, use JavaScript modules instead for server-side scripts. Modules support import/export, provide access to typed Glide APIs, and enable code reuse — see the module-guide topic. Now.include() is always the right choice for client-side scripts, HTML, and CSS, and is also required for server-side APIs whose script property only accepts strings.


When to use Now.include() vs modules

Not all APIs accept module imports. Some script properties are typed as string only — attempting to pass a module import will produce a compiler or build error. For example, you might see something like Type '() => void' is not assignable to type 'string', though the exact error will vary depending on your module's export shape and the API. When that happens, use Now.include().

Combining both: You can write business logic in a module and expose it through a string-only API by creating a thin wrapper script that uses require() to load the module. This is common for script includes that need to bridge module code to legacy callers (GlideAjax, cross-scope APIs). See the "Bridging Modules Through Script Includes" section in the script-include-guide topic.

| Content type | Recommended approach |
|---|---|
| Business rules, scripted REST routes, script actions, UI actions, scheduled scripts | Modules — these APIs accept function types |
| Record producer scripts (script, postInsertScript) | Modules — these APIs accept function types |
| Script includes | Now.include() — these APIs only accept strings |
| Client-side scripts (client scripts, catalog client scripts, UI policy scripts) | Now.include() — modules are not available in the browser |
| HTML templates (UI Pages, widgets) | Now.include() |
| CSS / SCSS (widgets, UI Pages) | Now.include() |
| Record API data fields | Now.include() — Record data values are strings |
| Any API where a module import causes a compiler/build error | Now.include() — fall back when the API doesn't support functions |


Syntax

```typescript fluent
Now.include(filePath: string): string
```

The file path is relative to the .now.ts file that contains the call.


How it works

1. At build time: The SDK reads the file and inlines its contents into the XML output field
2. At transform time (XML → Fluent): The SDK extracts field content into separate files and generates Now.include() calls in the .now.ts output

This enables a round-trip workflow where scripts are always maintained as standalone files.


Supported file types

| Type | Common extensions | Use case |
|------|------------------|----------|
| JavaScript | .js, .client.js | Client scripts, UI policy scripts, catalog client scripts |
| HTML | .html | UI Page HTML, widget templates |
| CSS/SCSS | .css, .scss | Widget styles, UI Page styles |


Examples

Client Script with external file

Client scripts run in the browser where modules are not available, so Now.include() is the correct approach:

```typescript fluent
import { ClientScript } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

ClientScript({
    $id: Now.ID['validate-form'],
    name: 'Validate Form',
    table: 'incident',
    type: 'onSubmit',
    script: Now.include('../../client/validate-form.client.js'),
})
```

```javascript
// client/validate-form.client.js
function onSubmit() {
    var desc = g_form.getValue('short_description');
    if (!desc) {
        g_form.addErrorMessage('Short description is required');
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

UI Page with HTML, client script, and processing script

```typescript fluent
import { UiPage } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

UiPage({
    $id: Now.ID['my-ui-page'],
    endpoint: 'my_custom_page.do',
    html: Now.include('../../server/UiPage/my-page.html'),
    clientScript: Now.include('../../server/UiPage/my-page.client-script.client.js'),
    processingScript: Now.include('../../server/UiPage/my-page.processing-script.server.js'),
})
```

Service Portal Widget

Widgets use Now.include() for client scripts, HTML, and CSS. Server scripts in widgets also use Now.include() because the widget server script runtime does not support modules.

```typescript fluent
import { SPWidget } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

SPWidget({
    $id: Now.ID['my-widget'],
    name: 'My Custom Widget',
    clientScript: Now.include('../../server/SPWidget/my-widget.client.js'),
    serverScript: Now.include('../../server/SPWidget/my-widget.server.js'),
    htmlTemplate: Now.include('../../server/SPWidget/my-widget.html'),
    customCss: Now.include('../../server/SPWidget/my-widget.scss'),
})
```

Record with HTML content

```typescript fluent
import { Record } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

Record({
    $id: Now.ID['my-record'],
    table: 'x_my_table',
    data: {
        name: 'My Record',
        description_html: Now.include('./html/description.html'),
    },
})
```


Inline scripts (alternative)

For very short client scripts, you can use inline strings instead of Now.include():

```typescript fluent
ClientScript({
    $id: Now.ID['simple-onload'],
    name: 'Welcome Message',
    table: 'incident',
    type: 'onLoad',
    script: `function onLoad() {
        g_form.addInfoMessage('Welcome!');
    }`,
})
```


When to use Now.include()

• Client-side scripts — modules are not available in the browser
• HTML and CSS content — templates, stylesheets, and markup
• APIs with string-only script properties — scheduled scripts, script includes, and others where the TypeScript type is string (not string | function)
• Record API data fields — all Record data values are strings
• Widget scripts — the SP widget runtime does not support modules
• Fallback for any API that rejects a module import — if the compiler or build reports a type mismatch when you pass a module import to a script property, the API is string-only; use Now.include()

For server-side scripts in APIs that accept functions (business rules, script actions, scripted REST routes, record producer scripts), prefer JavaScript modules — see the module-guide topic.
