System Properties

Guide for creating ServiceNow System Properties using the Fluent API. Properties store key-value configuration for applications, read at runtime using gs.getProperty(), and allow admins to tune behavior without code changes.


When to Use

• Adding configurable settings to an application (feature flags, thresholds, URLs)
• Storing values that admins should be able to change without modifying code
• Creating properties that business rules, scheduled scripts, or client code read at runtime


Instructions

1. Name with scope prefix: Property names must start with the application scope (e.g., x_snc_example.my_setting). Use dot notation to organize hierarchically (e.g., x_snc_example.email.enabled, x_snc_example.email.sender).
2. Choose the right type: Use string for text, integer for numbers, boolean for flags, choicelist for constrained options, password/password2 for secrets. The value field type must match.
3. Set access roles: Use the roles property to control who can read and write the property. Restrict write access to admin roles for sensitive settings.
4. Use isPrivate for sensitive data: Set isPrivate: true for properties that should not be visible in the property list UI (e.g., API keys, internal thresholds).
5. Provide a description: Always add a description explaining what the property controls and what valid values are -- this is what admins see when configuring the app.


Key Concepts

When to Use Properties vs Other Patterns

• Properties -- For values that change between environments or that admins tune (timeouts, feature flags, URLs)
• Business rules -- For logic that responds to data changes. Do not store logic in properties.
• Script includes -- For reusable code. Properties store data, not behavior.

Caching

Properties are cached by default for performance. Set ignoreCache: true only for properties that must reflect changes immediately (rare). Most properties should keep the default (false).


Avoidance

• Never omit the scope prefix from the name -- properties without scope prefix will fail validation
• Never store large data in properties -- they are for simple configuration values, not data blobs
• Never use ignoreCache: true unless necessary -- it forces a database read on every gs.getProperty() call, impacting performance

Examples

Basic String Property

```typescript fluent
import { Property } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

Property({
    $id: Now.ID['email-enabled'],
    name: 'x_snc_example.email.enabled',
    type: 'boolean',
    value: true,
    description: 'Enable or disable email notifications for the application',
    roles: {
        read: ['admin'],
        write: ['admin'],
    },
})
```

Property with Role References

```typescript fluent
import { Property, Role } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

const managerRole = Role({
    $id: Now.ID['manager_role'],
    name: 'x_snc_example.manager',
})

const adminRole = Role({
    $id: Now.ID['admin_role'],
    name: 'x_snc_example.admin',
    containsRoles: [managerRole],
})

Property({
    $id: Now.ID['1234'],
    name: 'x_snc_example.some.new.prop',
    type: 'string',
    value: 'hello',
    description: 'A new property',
    roles: {
        read: ['admin'],
        write: [adminRole, managerRole],
    },
    ignoreCache: false,
    isPrivate: false,
})
```
