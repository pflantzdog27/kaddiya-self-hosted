JavaScript Modules

JavaScript modules are the modern, preferred approach for all server-side code in Fluent projects. Modules support import/export, provide access to typed Glide APIs via @servicenow/glide, enable code reuse across your application, and integrate with third-party npm libraries.


When to Use

Use modules for server-side scripts in APIs that accept function types. Not all APIs support modules — some script properties only accept strings. If the compiler or build rejects a module import (for example, a type error such as Type '() => void' is not assignable to type 'string', or a similar diagnostic), the API does not support modules and you should use Now.include() instead (see the now-include-guide topic). The exact error will vary depending on the structure of your module export and the API you're targeting.

APIs that support modules (accept functions):
• BusinessRule, ScriptAction, UiAction — script property
• RestApi route handlers — script property
• CatalogItemRecordProducer — script and postInsertScript properties
• ScheduledScript — script property

APIs that require Now.include() or inline strings:
• ScriptInclude, ClientScript — script is string-only
• CatalogClientScript, CatalogUiPolicy, UiPolicy — script fields are string-only
• SPWidget — all script fields are string-only
• Record API — data values are strings

Additional use cases

• Organizing reusable server-side code into importable files
• Importing Glide APIs (gs, GlideRecord, etc.) for use in module files
• Adding third-party npm libraries to an application


Instructions

1. Module file location in src Module files must be placed in the serverModules directory defined in now.config.json, which defaults to src/server
2. Import Glide APIs explicitly: In module files, gs, GlideRecord, and other Glide APIs are NOT automatically available. You must import them from @servicenow/glide. Analyze your script for ALL ServiceNow APIs used and import each one.
3. Exception -- Script Include classes: When writing Script Include class files (Class.create pattern), do NOT import Glide APIs. They are automatically available in Script Include execution context. Only import other Script Include classes from @servicenow/glide/<scopeName>.
4. Use export/import in modules, require in scripts: Modules use ES module syntax (export/import). Business rules, script includes, and other server scripts use require to consume module exports.
5. Declare dependencies in package.json: Third-party npm libraries must be declared in dependencies. Never modify versions of existing dependencies unless explicitly requested.
6. Verify Glide API methods exist: Only use methods explicitly defined in @servicenow/glide type definitions. Do not assume methods exist based on naming conventions.
7. Use GlideDateTime instead of gs.nowDateTime() -- gs.nowDateTime() is not allowed in scoped applications.
8. Use Typescript for creating module code unless instructed to use Javascript explicitly


Key Concepts

Import Patterns

• Glide APIs in modules: import { gs, GlideRecord } from '@servicenow/glide'
• Namespaced APIs: import { RESTAPIRequest } from '@servicenow/glide/sn_ws_int'
• Script Include classes: import { MyClass } from '@servicenow/glide/x_my_scope'
• Module code in scripts: const { myFunction } = require('path/to/module')

Script Include Module Rules

This is the most common source of errors:

• Module files with normal functions -- MUST import Glide APIs from @servicenow/glide
• Module files with Script Include classes (Class.create) -- must NOT import Glide APIs (they are auto-available)
• Consuming Script Include classes from other modules -- import from @servicenow/glide/<scopeName>

Exposing Modules Through Script Includes

Many platform features still require script includes — GlideAjax, cross-scope APIs, and extension points that call script includes by name. When your logic lives in a module but needs to be accessible through these mechanisms, create a script include that acts as a thin bridge using require(). See the "Bridging Modules Through Script Includes" section in the script-include-guide topic for the full pattern and examples.

Subpath Imports

Use subpaths in package.json to create shorthand imports:

```json
{
    "imports": {
        "#calc": "calculus",
        "#derivative": "calculus/derivative"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "calculus": "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

Then use the shorthand:

```typescript fluent
import { derivative } from '#derivative'
import * as calculus from '#calc'
```

Limitations

• Modules work only within the application scope -- no cross-scope module sharing
• Node.js APIs are not supported
• Third-party libraries cannot access ServiceNow APIs such as GlideRecord and other imports from @servicenow/glide
• CommonJS modules from third-party libs are not supported unless they define exports
• Only a subset of ECMAScript features are supported


Avoidance

• Never use Glide APIs without importing them in module files -- they are NOT globally available in module context
• Never import Glide APIs in Script Include class files -- they ARE globally available in that context
• Never reference Script Include classes via global scope prefix in modules -- new x_myapp.MyUtils() only works in non-module server scripts. In modules, it throws a runtime error (x_myapp is not defined). Always use import { MyUtils } from '@servicenow/glide/x_myapp' instead.
• Never use methods not in @servicenow/glide type definitions -- ServiceNow's Glide objects have specific, limited APIs
• Never modify existing dependency versions in package.json -- only add new dependencies
• Never use gs.nowDateTime() in scoped apps -- use new GlideDateTime().getDisplayValue() instead


Examples

Full Pattern: Business Rule with Module

This is the recommended pattern for server-side scripts. Write the logic in a module file and import it in the .now.ts definition:

Fluent definition (src/fluent/business-rules/validate-request.now.ts):

```typescript fluent
import '@servicenow/sdk/global'
import { BusinessRule } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'
import { validateRequest } from '../../server/business-rules/validate-request'

BusinessRule({
    $id: Now.ID['validate-request'],
    name: 'Validate Request',
    table: 'x_myapp_request',
    when: 'before',
    action: ['insert', 'update'],
    script: validateRequest,
})
```

Module file (src/server/business-rules/validate-request.ts):

```typescript fluent
import { gs, GlideRecord } from '@servicenow/glide'

export function validateRequest(current: GlideRecord<'x_myapp_request'>, previous: GlideRecord<'x_myapp_request'>) {
    var title = current.getValue('short_description');
    if (!title) {
        gs.addErrorMessage('Short description is required');
        current.setAbortAction(true);
    }
}
```

Exporting from a Module

```typescript fluent
function myFunction() {}
const myVariable = 'value'

// Named exports for multiple features
export { myFunction, myVariable }
```

Importing in Another Module

```typescript fluent
import { feature } from 'path/to/module'
```

Importing in a Server Script (Business Rule, etc.)

```typescript fluent
const { feature } = require('path/to/module')
```

Importing Glide APIs in a Module

```typescript fluent
import { gs } from '@servicenow/glide'
import { GlideRecord } from '@servicenow/glide'

// Namespaced APIs
import { RESTAPIRequest, RESTAPIResponse } from '@servicenow/glide/sn_ws_int'
```

Using Script Include Classes from Modules

```typescript fluent
import { RecordUtils } from '@servicenow/glide/x_my_scope'

export function onRecordInsert(current, previous) {
    var recordUtils = new RecordUtils()
}
```

Adding Dependencies in package.json

```json
{
    "name": "test",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "dependencies": {
        "math": "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

When adding new dependencies, NEVER modify the versions of existing dependencies. Only add the new entry.
