ScriptInclude

Script includes are used to store JavaScript that runs on the server.
Create script includes to store JavaScript functions and classes for use by server scripts. Each script include defines either an object class or a function.


Signature

```typescript fluent
ScriptInclude(options)
```


Parameters

options

ScriptIncludeOptions

An Object containing the properties of the Script Include

Properties:

• $id (required): string | number | ExplicitKey<string>

• name (required): string
  The name of the script include. If you are defining a class, this must match the name of the class, prototype, and type. If you are using a classless (on-demand) script include, the name must match the function name.

• script (required): string
  Defines the server side script to run when called from other scripts.
  The script must define a single JavaScript class or a global function. The class or function name must match the Name field.
  Use Now.include() to keep the script in a separate file. Module imports are not supported (string-only property). Script Include class files (Class.create) should NOT import Glide APIs — they are auto-available. See the module-guide topic

• $meta (optional): object
  • installMethod: 'first install' | 'demo' | 'once'
    Map a record to an output folder that loads only in specific circumstances.
    'first install' - > 'unload',
    'demo' -> 'unload.demo'


• accessibleFrom (optional): 'public' | 'package_private'
  Sets which applications can access this script include (access field)
    • public: All application scopes

• callerAccess (optional): 'restriction' | 'tracking'
  Controls how external callers access the script include when accessibleFrom is 'public'. Only applies when accessibleFrom is 'public'.
    • restriction: Do not allow access unless an admin approves access by the scope
    • tracking: Allow access but track which scopes access the Script Include

• active (optional): boolean
  Enable or disable the script include

• apiName (optional): `${string}.${string}`
  The internal name of the Script Include. Used to call the Script Include from out-of-scope applications.  If not populated it will default to {scope}.{name}.

• clientCallable (optional): boolean
  The script include can be called from client-side scripts using GlideAjax.

• description (optional): string
  Documentation explaining the purpose and function of the Script Include

• mobileCallable (optional): boolean
  The script include is available to client scripts called from mobile devices.

• protectionPolicy (optional): 'read' | 'protected'
  The policy determines whether someone can view or edit the script include after the application is installed on their instance.
    • read: Allow other application developers to see your script logic, but not to change it.
    • protected: Prevent other application developers from changing this script include.
    • undefined Allow other application developers to customize your script include.

• sandboxCallable (optional): boolean
  Makes the script include callable from sandbox-evaluated expressions (e.g., javascript: filter conditions, query conditions, column default values). Only set true when specifically needed — it exposes the script include to the sandbox execution context. When a sandbox expression needs complex logic (variables, control flow, GlideRecord queries), create a sandboxCallable script include and call it as a single expression: new global.MyHelper().doCheck().




Examples

Script Include with External File

Create a script include with code in an external JavaScript file

```typescript fluent
/**
 * @title Script Include with External File
 * @description Create a script include with code in an external JavaScript file
 */
import { ScriptInclude } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

ScriptInclude({
    $id: Now.ID['my-script-include'],
    name: 'MyScriptInclude',
    active: true,
    apiName: 'x_scriptincludes.MyScriptInclude',
    script: Now.include('../../server/ScriptInclude/MyScriptInclude.server.js'),
})

```

MyScriptInclude.server.js

```javascript
var MyScriptInclude = Class.create()
MyScriptInclude.prototype = {
    initialize: () => {},

    example: () => {
        //example of using another script include and getting type information
        const processor = new global.AbstractAjaxProcessor()
        gs.info('This is an example script include method')
    },

    type: 'MyScriptInclude',
}
```

Client-Callable Script Include

Create an AJAX-enabled script include that can be called from client scripts

```typescript fluent
/**
 * @title Client-Callable Script Include
 * @description Create an AJAX-enabled script include that can be called from client scripts
 */
import { ScriptInclude } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

ScriptInclude({
    $id: Now.ID['ajax-script-include'],
    name: 'AjaxHelper',
    active: true,
    apiName: 'x_myapp.AjaxHelper',
    clientCallable: true,
    script: `var AjaxHelper = Class.create();
AjaxHelper.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, {
    getUserDisplayName: function() {
        var userId = this.getParameter('sysparm_user_id');
        var gr = new GlideRecord('sys_user');
        if (gr.get(userId)) {
            return gr.getDisplayValue('name');
        }
        return '';
    },

    type: 'AjaxHelper'
});`,
})

```

Script Include with Inline Code

Create a utility script include with inline JavaScript methods

```typescript fluent
/**
 * @title Script Include with Inline Code
 * @description Create a utility script include with inline JavaScript methods
 */
import { ScriptInclude } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

ScriptInclude({
    $id: Now.ID['inline-script-include'],
    name: 'UtilityHelper',
    active: true,
    apiName: 'x_myapp.UtilityHelper',
    script: `var UtilityHelper = Class.create();
UtilityHelper.prototype = {
    initialize: function() {},

    formatDate: function(dateStr) {
        var gdt = new GlideDateTime(dateStr);
        return gdt.getDisplayValue();
    },

    isValidEmail: function(email) {
        var emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
        return emailRegex.test(email);
    },

    type: 'UtilityHelper'
};`,
})

```
