Examples

Business Rule with External Script (Module)

Create a business rule that uses an external JavaScript file for the script logic. In this example, we are using a modern modular JavaScript file, importing the function using a regular import statement.

```typescript fluent
import { BusinessRule } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'
import { logStateChange } from '../../server/business-rules/businessLogic'

export const LogIncidentStateChange = BusinessRule({
    $id: Now.ID['log_state_change'],
    name: 'Log State Change',
    table: 'incident',
    when: 'after',
    action: ['update'],
    script: logStateChange,
})
```

businessLogic.ts

```typescript fluent
import { gs } from '@servicenow/glide'

export function logStateChange(current: any, previous: any) {
    const title = current.getValue('title')
    const currentState = current.getValue('state')
    const previousState = previous.getValue('state')
    gs.addInfoMessage(`"${title}" updated from "${previousState}" to "${currentState}"`)
}
```

Business Rule with External Script (Non-modular, using Now.include)

Create a business rule that uses an external JavaScript file for the script logic. In this example, we are not using modern modular JavaScript. Instead, it's written as a plain legacy script without imports or exports, and we are using Now.include() to drop it into the business rule.

```typescript fluent
import { BusinessRule } from '@servicenow/sdk/core'

export const LogIncidentStateChange = BusinessRule({
    $id: Now.ID['log_state_change'],
    name: 'Log State Change',
    table: 'incident',
    when: 'after',
    action: ['update'],
    script: Now.include('../../server/business-rules/businessLogic.server.js'),
})
```

businessLogic.server.js

```typescript fluent
var title = current.getValue('title');
var currentState = current.getValue('state');
var previousState = previous.getValue('state');
gs.addInfoMessage(`"${title}" updated from "${previousState}" to "${currentState}"`);
```
