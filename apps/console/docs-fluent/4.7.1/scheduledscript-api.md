  Time of day when the job runs

• frequency (optional): RunType
  Frequency at which the job runs.

  The policy determines whether someone can view or edit the scheduled job after the application is installed.
  • read: Allow other developers to see the script logic, but not change it

  • undefined: Allow other developers to customize the scheduled job

• repeatEvery (optional): number
  For recurring trigger types, repeat only every Nth occurrence (e.g., 3 means every 3rd occurrence)

  User whose credentials are used to execute the scheduled job (sys_id or username)

• script (optional): string | (...args: any[]) => void
  Script to be executed when the job runs.
  Use Now.include('./script.js') for file-based editing with full IDE support (recommended),
  or provide an inline string. Module imports are not supported (string-only property)

  Time zone in which the job runs. Accepts 'floating' for system time zone,
  or any IANA timezone identifier (e.g. 'UTC', 'US/Pacific', 'America/New_York').

    gr.addQuery('sys_created_on', '<', gs.daysAgo(90))
    gr.query()
    var deletedCount = 0

    while (gr.next()) {
        gr.deleteRecord()
        deletedCount++
    }

    gs.info('Data cleanup completed. Deleted ' + deletedCount + ' records.')
})()
```

Scheduled Script with Offset
